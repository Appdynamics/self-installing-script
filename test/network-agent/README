Network Agent ZIP instructions

The instructions on how to install and run appd-netviz from zip package is
divided into 2 parts. The 1st part covers the instructions for the
administrator and the 2nd part covers the instructions for the Network agent
user. Administrator is someone who has full sudo access or root access on the
system. Network agent user is the person who is going to use the package on a
day to day basis.

Instructions for administrator

1. Get the network agent zip package from Appdynamics and unzip it at a
   location where the Network agent user has access to. For example, the users
   home directory.
   #unzip <pkg.zip> -d <network_agent_home>
   where pkg.zip is the name of the zip archive and network_agent_home is the
   name of the directory where you want to install the agent.

2. Change ownership of all files in network_agent_home to that of the user who
   is going to use the agent.
   #chown -R <network_agent_user>:<network_agent_user> <network_agent_home>
   where network_agent_user is the user who is going to use the agent. 

3. Go to network_agent_home directory and run the install script.
   #cd <network_agent_home>
   #./install.sh
