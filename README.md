# self-installing-script
This is a self installing script to facilitate installation of agents. Just run the script and it will generate the corresponding directories with the right permissions.

On this current version script works just for Linux, script will only self extract itself, create the right folders under <appdynamics-home> directory and set the right permissions. For network-agent, script will also try to install it using sudo.

Still there is a lot to do, but this is a first version of the script.
